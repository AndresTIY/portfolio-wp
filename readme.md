## Portfolio

#### Introduction

From the lectures I've attended and from podcasts I've listened to, portfolio seems to not matter. Github is the most important. From the **Syntax** podcast, Wes Bos talked about how his portfolio was made up of broken links. His clients rarely looked at his portfolio because his initial clients would refer him to other people.

In my situation, I would like to focus a bit more on freelancing. I can't create an account/profile on freelancing sites such as **Upwork** without one. Since I'm shifting my focus to freelancing, knowing WordPress is a very important skill to have.

The purpose of my portfolio is to learn WordPress and showcase the skills I have learned.
